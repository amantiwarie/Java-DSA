You are given an n x n integer matrix. You can do the following operation any number of times:

Choose any two adjacent elements of matrix and multiply each of them by -1.
Two elements are considered adjacent if and only if they share a border.

Your goal is to maximize the summation of the matrix's elements. Return the maximum sum of the matrix's elements using the operation mentioned above.

 

Example 1:


Input: matrix = [[1,-1],[-1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can follow the following steps to reach sum equals 4:
- Multiply the 2 elements in the first row by -1.
- Multiply the 2 elements in the first column by -1.


class Solution {
    public long maxMatrixSum(int[][] matrix) {
        int n = matrix.length;

        int leastElement = 100001;
        long sum = 0L;
        int negativeCount = 0;

        for(int[] rows : matrix ){
            for(int value : rows){
                if(value < 0){
                    negativeCount++;
                    value = -value;
                }

                sum += value;
                if(value < leastElement){
                    leastElement = value;
                }
                
            }
        }

        return (negativeCount%2 == 0) ? sum : (sum - 2*leastElement);
    }
}
