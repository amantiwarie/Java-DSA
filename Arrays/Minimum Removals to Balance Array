You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

An array is considered balanced if the value of its maximum element is at most k times the minimum element.

You may remove any number of elements from nums​​​​​​​ without making it empty.

Return the minimum number of elements to remove so that the remaining array is balanced.

Note: An array of size 1 is considered balanced as its maximum and minimum are equal, and the condition always holds true.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,1,5], k = 2

Output: 1

Explanation:

Remove nums[2] = 5 to get nums = [2, 1].
Now max = 2, min = 1 and max <= min * k as 2 <= 1 * 2. Thus, the answer is 1.

class Solution {
    public int minRemoval(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i = 0, j = 0; i < n; i ++){
            while(j + 1 < n && (long) nums[i] * (long) k >= nums[j + 1]){
                j ++;
            }
            ans = Math.max(ans, j - i + 1);
        }
        return n - ans;
    }
}
